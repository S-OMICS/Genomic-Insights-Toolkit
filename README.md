# DNA Analysis and Protein Synthesis Pipeline

## Description

This project is a simple bioinformatics pipeline that analyzes DNA sequences. It includes functionalities for calculating GC content, finding the reverse complement, transcribing to RNA, translating RNA into proteins, and more.

## Features

1. **Reverse Complement**: Generates the reverse complement of the DNA sequence.
2. **GC Content Calculation**: Computes the GC content of the DNA sequence.
3. **Transcription**: Converts a DNA sequence to its RNA counterpart.
4. **Translation**: Translates RNA sequences into protein sequences.
5. **Codon Usage Calculation**: Analyzes codon frequencies and visualizes the usage.
6. **ORF Finder**: Finds open reading frames in the DNA sequence.
7. **k-mer Frequency Calculation**: Calculates the frequency of k-mers in the DNA sequence.
8. **Motif Search**: Searches for specific motifs within the sequence.
